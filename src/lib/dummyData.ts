    title: "Application of Support Vector Machine (SVM) Model in Multi-Factor Stock Selection Models",
    abstract: "This study references the Huatai Research Report Artificial Intelligence Stock Selection via Support Vector Machine Model, analyzes its results, and explores the application of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model in the field of multi-factor stock selection models. It aims to establish a nonlinear model between stock factors and returns and evaluates the model through multi-dimensional analysis.",
